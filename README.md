#  CNVSeg Dataset for CNV
The CNV dataset includes three types of OCTA imaging devices. Heidelberg, SVision, and Zeiss, respectively. All data were obtained from Ningbo Eye Hospital, China. These datasets included 224 acquisitions centered around the macula, with scan ranges covering 
$3 \times 3mm^2$; $6 \times 6mm^2$; $9 \times 9mm^2$, and image resolutions of $304 \times 304$ and $384 \times 384$ pixels. The images used for the experiments were en-face images of the avascular complex, spanning from the Outer Plexiform Layer (OPL) to Bruchâ€™s Membrane (BM) and Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE). 
The data annotation process was conducted as follows: two ophthalmologists performed the initial CNV annotation using ITK-SNAP. To address any ambiguity, 3D OCTA image visualization was referenced to assist both experts in verifying the CNV lesions. After completing the annotations, a cross-validation procedure was carried out by the two experts to ensure consistency. In cases of disagreement, the annotations were reviewed by a senior ophthalmologist for confirmation. Finally, a second senior ophthalmologist conducted a thorough review and made final revisions.
